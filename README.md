Ramdom Create Sudoku Puzzle in Python

First, randomly create a completed sudoku solution.
From the sudoku solution, constantly remove numbers at random locations.
For each removal, check if the sudoku is still valid. That is, the sudoku has a unique solution.
If not, we put back the number and try another location. 
The process keeps going until all locations have tried.
